# My Impossible List

**This is NOT a bucket list!**

The idea was originally from [Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) and I based my list on [Thomas Frank's](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/) version.

The impossible list should always evolve, listing experiences that lead to other experiences. Somehow it ends up inspiring others as well as yourself and, more importantly, it compels you to take action. I was quite impressed to see that I've already completed some of my goals, it really is an awesome exercise.
