# About Me

[![Photo of Livia Lima](LL.jpg "Click to see my LinkedIn profile")](https://www.linkedin.com/in/livialima/)

Hi! üñêüèª I'm Livia Lima, a tech enthusiast with expertise in Linux and open-source technologies. Through platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube, I share knowledge and resources in the tech community. My involvement in projects like the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org) showcases my dedication to community learning and development. I've been publishing technical tutorials on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@livia2lima) channel and I'm committed to promoting open-source culture and empowering others in the field. 

I usually combine that excitement with 15 years of experience supporting IT infrastructure (network, storage, and application servers), delivering great customer service.

Outside of technology, I enjoy [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/12163736583 "the music I listen to"), [craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/livialima "the beers I drink"), [comic books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113604841-livia-lima "the books I read") and rugby. I've done [crossfit](https://games.crossfit.com/athlete/1689757 "Shame on me, I haven't been in a box in years!") in the past but today I keep my stress levels down by doing some light hiking and drinking tea.

Currently working outside my comfort zone as a Prototype Technician. Being more hands-on with electrical and mechanical components has been challenging and very rewarding! I don't know when (or if) I'll be back to IT, but I've been living one day at a time since I moved to Canada from Brazil. It's a life changing experience and for now I'm just enjoying the journey.

# Awesome stuff I did

I'm a member of the [Linux Professional Institute](https://people.lpi.org/m/LPI000190681), LPIC-1, LFCA and specialized in other infrastructure technologies like Storage and Network. I've got a few shiny badges on [Credly](https://www.credly.com/users/livia-lima/badges?sort=-state_updated_at&page=1) to prove it. 

Here's a short list of things I've done that I'm proud of:

**I'm the Project Lead for the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org)**, a volunteer project that helps those who want to learn more about how to operate a Linux server. Since 2020, I've helped about **30,000 students** from all over the world in their Linux journey.

In addition to the written material, I produced and published a complimentary video series on YouTube, achieving a total view count of 50,000+ and receiving positive feedback from 95% of viewers. We just hit **1k subscribers** in 2024, and continue to grow!

My goal was to simplify the most basic concepts of Linux for system administration.

**Created a static website on AWS from scratch** - yes, this one you are seeing right now. It started as a personal project to get my feet wet in the AWS pound. A lot has changed since then, I'm no longer on AWS but I can get myself around with static content hosting now.

**Surrounded myself with Cisco certified analysts** by training my peers. I just wanted my folks to succeed (support life can be hard, y'all), so I started teaching what I knew and learning a lot along the way. Through structured training and coaching, the number of analysts that had no previous experience with network technology to Cisco certified professionals shot up 35% in a spam of 2 years. Many of them left the company because a certification gave them more chances at a better life and this is what I cherish the most. While this experience showed me how to implement technical courses and skill assessments, I hope everyone that ever attended one of my classes is happy today with the knowledge I shared.

**Successfully mishmashed two teams without burning the department to the ground**, meaning I transitioned Voice support to integrate to my former Network Support team. Anyone that experienced a merge knows the nightmare it can be. All the structured training that I was doing beforehand (see the Cisco bit before) enabled the whole department to not go completely nuts when we started taking incidents we never have seen before. For the higher-ups, I increased efficiency by 20% through process deployment. For my peers, this streamlined operations, making the integration within the network infrastructure a lot less painful and reducing resolution time by 15%.

**Saved $50k** for a major US bank client. Their network circuit and telephone line inventory was a mess, they were actually paying another company to manage that mess. Every day I received maintenance notices for lines that were no longer in use. I got fed-up and decided to share my findings with them - that's called "implementing efficient governance measures" in corporate jargon. That other company don't like me very much. It's impressive what a spreadsheet and a lot of coffee can do.
