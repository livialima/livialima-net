## About the site
I initially built it using CI/CD techniques in AWS but keeping the blog posts was a bit cumbersome. So I moved most of it to [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) and used the repo for backup and integration purposes.

But I didn't like the Hashnode editor and I was bored. So everything is now in a MkDocs workflow. Hope I can keep this going.
