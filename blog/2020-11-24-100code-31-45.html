<h1>100 Days of Code - Days 31 to 45</h1>
<p>This is the third retrospective of my <a href="../challenges/100-days-of-code.html">#100DaysOfCode</a>.</p>

<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p>I coded for <strong>9 hours and 41 minutes</strong>, according to <a href="https://wakatime.com/" target="_blank">WakaTime</a>. But since I don’t have the premium subscription (and therefore cannot see past 14 days), I believe it was much more. Too many breaks and time-offs made a huge dent on my performance.<br>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong> are still the top languages, as expected.<br>

<h2>Rocked (or things that went really well):</h2>
<p><strong>Shell Scripting</strong>: I started the <a href="../challenges/linux-upskill.html">Linux Upskill Challenge</a> and with that I had the opportunity to finally nail my shell scripting. Much of what I’ve been doing in the last two weeks was completely focused on Linux, so I’m expecting to get that right.</p>

<h2>Flopped (or things that I should consider stop doing):</h2>
<p><strong>Distractions</strong>: 6-day gaps became more frequent, and it frustrated me. There was the <a href="https://games.crossfit.com/" target="_blank">CrossFit Games</a>, the new <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-33/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> release and then I decided to do the <a href="../challenges/linux-upskill.html">Linux Upskill Challenge</a>! No wonder I slipped so much…</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <a href="../challenges/linux-upskill.html">Linux Upskill Challenge</a> really got me excited to try and master Shell Scripting and all things Linux. My schedule is unconventional but I’m getting there, eventually.</p>
