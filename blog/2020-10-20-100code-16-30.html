<h1>100 Days of Code - Days 16 to 30</h1>
<p>This is the second retrospective of my <a href="../challenges/100-days-of-code.html">#100DaysOfCode</a>.</p>

<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p>I coded for <strong>24 hours and 4 minutes</strong>, according to <a href="https://wakatime.com/" target="_blank">WakaTime</a>. That is a huge improvement! The first 15 days didn't get past 14 hours.<br>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is still the top language as I'm using it much more for this website maintenance. However, this time around I was working on a different project and I had the opportunity to tap into different languages besides <strong>Python</strong>.<br>

<h2>Rocked (or things that went really well):</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access to high-quality material</strong>: Still a good one. This time I used <a href="https://acloudguru.com/" target="_blank">A Cloud Guru</a> to get Python into the real world of cloud. Which leads us to the next item.</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: to further my practice, I continued the <a href="../challenges/cloud-resume.html">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> from where I stopped. When I first published my website I wanted it to be as simple as possible so, although heavily based, I avoided the coding part of the challenge. Now I had to study Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway. Still going with AWS SAM for the last touches of <strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong> and testing my Python functions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Flopped (or things that I should consider stop doing):</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Distractions</strong>: it seems all fine and dandy, but there was a 6-day gap between the days 19 and 20. Life got in the way pretty hard. I was about to quit when the <strong>100DaysOfCode community</strong> suggested I just hop back on the coding wagon and so I kept going.</li>
<li><strong>Not having a structure</strong>: I sorted this out by picking a project at a time. I'm not thinking too much ahead, just finishing one project and preparing for the next.</li>
</ol>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <a href="../challenges/cloud-resume.html">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> really got me excited to apply the Python I learned in the first 15 days, using AWS Lambda. It was a nice and short piece of code.</p>
