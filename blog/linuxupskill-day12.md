## Objectives of the day
1. [SFTP](../howtos/basic-sftp.html): transfer files over SSH.
2. [FileZilla](../howtos/basic-filezilla.html): transfer files over SFTP with a nice GUI.
3. [rsync](../howtos/basic-rsync.html): "remote sync", copies and synchronizes files and directories remotely as well as locally.
