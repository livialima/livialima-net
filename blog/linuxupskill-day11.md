# Day 11 : Finding things...

This is part of the [#LinuxUpSkillChallenge](../challenges/linux-upskill.html). Don't forget to also check out the [Official Instructions](https://github.com/snori74/linuxupskillchallenge/blob/master/11.md) and the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/) posts.

## Objectives of the day
1. ```locate```: It searches through a prebuilt database of files generated by the updatedb command or by a daemon and compressed using incremental encoding. It operates significantly faster than find, but requires regular updating of the databas
2. ```find```: locates files based on some user-specified criteria and then applies some requested action on each matched object.
3. ```grep -R```: recursively searches for text, getting down directories and symbolic links.
4. ```which```: identify the location of executables.
