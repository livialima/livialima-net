<h1>100 Days of Code - Days 1 to 15</h1>
<p>This is the first retrospective of my <a href="../challenges/100-days-of-code.html">#100DaysOfCode</a>, compiling the impressions of the first 15 days into the challenge.</p>

<h2 class="highlight">Metrics</h2>
<p>I coded for <strong>14 hours and 4 minutes</strong>, according to <a href="https://wakatime.com/" target="_blank">WakaTime</a>. However, it does not count the coding I did before installing WakaTime(that happened on Day 3) or the coding inside <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">CodeWars</a>(started on Day 8).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/100daysofcode-01-14-graph-hours.png"></p>
<p>Almost half of the time was expent with <strong>Python</strong> on projects, the rest of the time was with <strong>HTML and Markdown</strong> (both for this website maintenance).

<h2 class="highlight">Rocked (or things that went really well):</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Access to high-quality material</strong>: I followed <a href="https://henriquebastos.net/" target="_blank">Henrique Bastos</a> courses awhile. I attended the <strong>Welcome to the Django</strong> talk at <a href="http://softwarelivre.org/fisl16" target="_blank">FISL16</a> and got hooked by his expertise since then. Best course I ever purchased. The material is extremely hands-on and the theory is very easy to follow.</li>
<li><strong>Diversifying resources</strong>: to further my practice in some language fundamentals like dictionaries and lists, I referred to <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">CodeWars</a>. There I could grab challenges in different difficult levels to train the same concepts I was struggling with. <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> is also a good one.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="highlight">Flopped (or things that I should consider stop doing):</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Code in the evenings</strong>: it feels like completing a school assignment in the very last minute. Stressful. I do not like it. The code doesn't either; meaning it sucks more the later I start coding.</li>
<li><strong>Not having a structure</strong>: not knowing what I am supposed to study inevitably makes me waste a lot of time deciding WHAT to code in the first place. That leaves less time to figure out HOW to code.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="highlight">Project Ideas (or things that came to me while learning to code):</h2>
<ol>
<li>Subtitle linter for my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LiviaNobregaLima" target="_blank">videos</a>, since YouTube's closed-captions have problems with my accent, apparently...</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="highlight">In Conclusion</h2>
<p>I learned a lot this 15 days and I expect the same in upcoming weeks. I'll write technical blog posts in the future, when not everything confuses me. For now, I'm documenting my journey from 1 to 100 days.</p>
