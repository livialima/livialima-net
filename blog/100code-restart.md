# 100 Days of Code - Restarting...

After great consideration, I decided to start over the [#100DaysOfCode](../challenges/100-days-of-code.html) challenge.

After almost one month without properly coding, I see no point in return to the last point if I'm not going to give the attention it deserves.

That doesn't mean I'm quitting. NOT AT ALL!

My fault, it seems, was being too eager too soon. Trying to stuff way more content that I could handle. So I'm getting back to the basics.

So, following the recommendations my Twitter family gave me, I'm taking small bites from now on. I'm also decreasing the hurdle of posting my progress by automating it with [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@livialima).

**Happy Coding!**
