## Objectives of the day
1. **Install Apache**: use ```sudo apt install apache2```
2. **Learn about system services:**

```sudo systemctl status service``` - check status of a service

```sudo systemctl start service``` - start service

```sudo systemctl stop service``` - stop service

```sudo systemctl enable service``` - enable service, to have it to run automatically when the server boots
