<h2>1. Practice and explore the command line</h2>
<p>No better way to improve your command line skills than to actual practice them!</p>
<p>Take the challenge, go into the extentions and explore at your hearts content.</p>
<p>Some useful resources are <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com/" target="_blank">Command Line Challenge</a> and <a href="https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/browse" target="_blank">CommandLineFu</a></p>
<h2>2. Experiment with your server</h2>
<p>Experiment with your server, add applications that you want to try.</p>
<p>Go after the documentation and turn your server into a webserver, a file server, a mirror, a mailserver, dataserver… you name it!</p>
<h2>3. Bring Linux home</h2>
<p>Servers are nice up in the cloud, but is Linux any good for the desktop?</p>
<p>You don’t have to switch to Linux on your desktop if you don’t want to. I actually recommend that you DON’T. A bad domestic experience often scare off many potential users.</p>
<p>This step is totally optional. But trying to run things for your own personal use teaches a lot about the system dynamics. It unveils features, roadblocks and their work-arounds.</p>
<p>Try a LiveUSB running a user-friendly distro like Ubuntu first. Maybe try to install in dual-boot later.</p>
<p>Ah, and don’t stick to Ubuntu only! There are so many flavors available that there is a catalog of all of the distributions ever released: <a href="https://distrowatch.com/" target="_blank">Distro Watch</a></p>
<h2>4. Take a course</h2>
<p>Feeling that a bit more guided experience suits you better? Try taking a course. Where you can find good content:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/cloudassessments/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> always have sale discounts and some free courses.</li>
<li><a href="https://acloudguru.com/browse-training?vendors%5B%5D=linux&amp;skill%5B%5D=apprentice&amp;skill%5B%5D=beginner&amp;skill%5B%5D=intro&amp;skill%5B%5D=practitioner" target="_blank">A Cloud Guru</a> aquired the old Linux Academy and all of their courses. An obvious choice if you want to explore Linux into the cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/linux" target="_blank">CBT Nuggets</a> is another no-brainer. Although a bit pricey, the courses are of the highest quality. Money well spent.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=linux" target="_blank">LinkedIn Learning</a> is an option if you already have a LinkedIn premium account. It offers from quick tutorials to entire courses.</li>
<li>For more free material, YouTube is usually the way to go. Channels I recommend: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/tutoriaLinux/videos" target="_blank">tutorialLinux</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech/videos" target="_blank">ChrisTitusTech</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/videos" target="_blank">Computerphile</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=freecodecamp+linux" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. For Portuguese speakers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LinuxTips/videos" target="_blank">LINUXtips</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SlackJeff/videos" target="_blank">SlackJeff</a> comes to mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Get certified</h2>
<p>A certification is absolutely NOT REQUIRED to work in system administration. Some companies ask for them, much more as a formality. But if you cannot show any experience in the resume, it’s good to have at least one cert to get a foot in the door.</p>
<p>The closest this course can get you, as far as exam objectives are concerned, is Linux Professional Institute’s <a href="https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-overview" target="_blank">LE-1 Linux Essentials</a>. It may be a good start but it’s barely noticed in job hunting.</p>
<p>Any relevant certification will require a lot more study in topics not covered by this challenge, like hardware and system architecture.</p>
<p>Certifications that have actual influence:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview" target="_blank">LPIC-1 : Linux Administrator</a>. Also by Linux Professional Institute, it’s been around the longest. More detailed, it requires two exams to pass. It’s pretty much distro neutral, which also means you need to know the differences between Fedora and Ubuntu, for example. Good investiment if you want to became a Linux expert later and intent to pursue LPIC-2 and LPIC-3 certs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux" target="_blank">CompTIA Linux+</a> is more like a compact version of LPIC-1 with only one exam. A better option for those not keen to endure several exams.</li>
<li><a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/" target="_blank">LFCS</a> is issued by the Linux Foundation, the same organization that apply exam certs for Kubernetes.</li>
<li>RedHat <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa" target="_blank">RHCSA</a> is the hot cert that everyone knows, simply because RedHat is the distro of choice for business. It requires a lot of study and a lot of money, and provides the best result.</li>
</ul>
