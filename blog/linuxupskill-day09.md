This is part of the [#LinuxUpSkillChallenge](../challenges/linux-upskill.html). Don't forget to also check out the [Official Instructions](https://github.com/snori74/linuxupskillchallenge/blob/master/09.md) and the [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/comments/jsfhte/day_9_ports_open_and_closed/) posts.

## Objectives of the day
1. **TCP/IP ports**
  - 22 : SSH
  - 80 : HTTP

2. **Port Status**
 - ```netstat```: "network status" plays network connections and statistics.
 - ```ss```: "socket status" is a standard utility replacing the older netstat.
 - ```nmap```: "network map" is a port scanner, won't normally be installed by default.

3. **Host Firewall**
 - ```ufw```: "uncomplicated firewall" is a frontend for ```iptables```.
 - ```iptables```: manages firewall rules.
 - ```nftables```: a package filtering framework built to replace the old ```iptables```.
