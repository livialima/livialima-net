Through platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube, I share knowledge and resources in the tech community. My involvement in projects like the Linux Upskill Challenge showcases my dedication to community learning and development. I\u2019ve been publishing technical tutorials on my YouTube channel and I\u2019m committed to promoting open-source culture and empowering others in the field. </p> <p>I usually combine that excitement with 15 years of experience supporting IT infrastructure (network, storage, and application servers), delivering great customer service.</p> <p>Outside of technology, I enjoy music, craft beer, comic books and rugby. I\u2019ve done crossfit in the past but today I keep my stress levels down by doing some light hiking and drinking tea.</p> <p>Currently working outside my comfort zone as a Prototype Technician. Being more hands-on with electrical and mechanical components has been challenging and very rewarding! I don\u2019t know when (or if) I\u2019ll be back to IT, but I\u2019ve been living one day at a time since I moved to Canada from Brazil. It\u2019s a life changing experience and for now I\u2019m just enjoying the journey.</p>"},{"location":"#awesome-stuff-i-did","title":"Awesome stuff I did","text":"<p>I\u2019m a member of the Linux Professional Institute, LPIC-1, LFCA and specialized in other infrastructure technologies like Storage and Network. I\u2019ve got a few shiny badges on Credly to prove it. </p> <p>Here\u2019s a short list of things I\u2019ve done that I\u2019m proud of:</p> <p>I\u2019m the Project Lead for the Linux Upskill Challenge, a volunteer project that helps those who want to learn more about how to operate a Linux server. Since 2020, I\u2019ve helped about 30,000 students from all over the world in their Linux journey.</p> <p>In addition to the written material, I produced and published a complimentary video series on YouTube, achieving a total view count of 50,000+ and receiving positive feedback from 95% of viewers. We just hit 1k subscribers in 2024, and continue to grow!</p> <p>My goal was to simplify the most basic concepts of Linux for system administration.</p> <p>Created a static website on AWS from scratch - yes, this one you are seeing right now. It started as a personal project to get my feet wet in the AWS pound. A lot has changed since then, I\u2019m no longer on AWS but I can get myself around with static content hosting now.</p> <p>Surrounded myself with Cisco certified analysts by training my peers. I just wanted my folks to succeed (support life can be hard, y\u2019all), so I started teaching what I knew and learning a lot along the way. Through structured training and coaching, the number of analysts that had no previous experience with network technology to Cisco certified professionals shot up 35% in a spam of 2 years. Many of them left the company because a certification gave them more chances at a better life and this is what I cherish the most. While this experience showed me how to implement technical courses and skill assessments, I hope everyone that ever attended one of my classes is happy today with the knowledge I shared.</p> <p>Successfully mishmashed two teams without burning the department to the ground, meaning I transitioned Voice support to integrate to my former Network Support team. Anyone that experienced a merge knows the nightmare it can be. All the structured training that I was doing beforehand (see the Cisco bit before) enabled the whole department to not go completely nuts when we started taking incidents we never have seen before. For the higher-ups, I increased efficiency by 20% through process deployment. For my peers, this streamlined operations, making the integration within the network infrastructure a lot less painful and reducing resolution time by 15%.</p> <p>Saved $50k for a major US bank client. Their network circuit and telephone line inventory was a mess, they were actually paying another company to manage that mess. Every day I received maintenance notices for lines that were no longer in use. I got fed-up and decided to share my findings with them - that\u2019s called \u201cimplementing efficient governance measures\u201d in corporate jargon. That other company don\u2019t like me very much. It\u2019s impressive what a spreadsheet and a lot of coffee can do.</p>"},{"location":"#awesome-stuff-i-post","title":"Awesome stuff I post","text":"<p>My other interests can be found throughout my social media accounts, each to some degree.</p> <ul> <li>YouTube</li> <li>Mastodon</li> <li>LinkedIn</li> <li>Instagram</li> <li>Twitch</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#awesome-support-from-you","title":"Awesome support from you","text":"<p>If you appreciate my work, you can buy me a coffee or become my sponsor if you feel extra generous.</p> <p>DISCLAIMER : The opinions expressed on this page are my own views and not those of any of my employers, past or present.
